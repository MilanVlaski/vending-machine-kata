Urgently refactor the display method.
tryToPurchase is called after selecting an item, and in the method, we check
if item is selected, which is dumb.
similarly, when called in the insert method.

Maybe write a bunch of more complex tests for the display, that checks whether
the display is showing exactly what it should after every user input.

i should mock that coinreturn.add() was called, because i dont have access
to the coinreturn, i cant actually programatically test that.
