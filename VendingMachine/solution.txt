Maybe write a bunch of more complex tests for the display, that checks whether
the display is showing exactly what it should after every user input.

EXACT CHANGE ONLY when coinstock is empty, makes sense.

You can either give a warning when machine is KINDA empty.
(because if its not totally empty, there is still a chance you wont receive
proper change)

Or, we can do a check every time we try to purchase, letting the user decide
if he wants to get his money back, continue shopping, or proceed with the purchase.

We need a minimum of 4 nickels, to be able to always return the right change
given the ValidCoins we currently accept.

Smallest coin is worth 5, largest is 25. That means the most change
that can be created is worth 20. And to always be able to make that, or anything
in between, we need 4 *5 . Which is 4 nickels.
