instead of testing that display is showing "thank you" the display can be in 
a thankful state or something

Coin stock.
INSERT COIN is the ready state
THANK YOU - is a purchase successful state
SOLD OUT - is an error state
PRICE = 10 - you show if an item is selected (only in ready state)

Urgently refactor the display method.
tryToPurchase is called after selecting an item, and in the method, we check
if item is selected, which is dumb.
similarly, when called in the insert method.
