Item value being written both in tests and in code
is bad. It should only remain in the code.
Also item names, coin names...

****Penny rejection means the same string shows up in the coinReturn.


im testing the display and the model in the same test case...
This makes sense, because they share the same setup.


Coinreturn cannot have a float value, it should return valid coins.
For that to happen, it needs to calculate the change, then return it as coins.
