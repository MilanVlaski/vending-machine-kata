Item value being written both in tests and in code
is bad. It should only remain in the code.
Also item names, coin names...

Our coin returns functions as a value holder (with invalid coins having no value)
This is wrong. Enum for valid coins kinda makes sense, but invalid coins can be
any string maybe.

Penny rejection means the same string shows up in the coinReturn.

Change cannot have a double value, it should return valid coins.

im testing the display and the model in the same test case...
This makes sense, because they share the same setup.
